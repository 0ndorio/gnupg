    * Fix ;) revocation and expire stuff.

    * OpenBSD: dynamic loading with dlopen works on OpenBSD, but:
	OpenBSD binaries are a.out, so every symbol begins with "_"

    * should we flush the getkey.c caches while doing an import?

    * prefer a type 16 subkey for encryption because pgp cannot handle
      type 20?

    * calculation of marginals never yields a completely trusted key.

    * The critical bit of signature subpackets is not yet supported; i.e.
      it is ignored.

    * Exportable Certification Flag is ignored

    * We need a maintainence pass over the trustdb which flags
      signatures as expired if the key used to make the signature has
      expired.	Maybe it is a good idea to store the exiration time
      in the key record of the trustdb.

    * write a tool to extract selected keys from a file.

    * new menu to delete signatures and list signature in menu

    * commandline controlled --edit-key with assumed save.

    * -rdynamic auf Solaris Problem

    * Replace the SIGUSR1 stuff by semaphores to avoid loss of a signal.

    * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)

    * add some sanity checks to read_keyblock, so that we are sure that
     the minimal requirements are met (?)

    * decryption of message with multiple recipients does not work.

    * preferences of hash algorithms are not yet used.

    * rewrite --list-packets or put it into another tool.

    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
      really make sense?

    * Change the buffering to a mbuf like scheme? Need it for PSST anyway.
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * remove all "Fixmes"

    * Change the internal represention of keyid into a struct which
      can also hold the localid and extend the localid to hold information
      of the subkey number because two subkeys may have the same keyid.

    * add an option to re-create a public key from a secret key; we
      can do this in trustdb.c:verify_own_keys.

    * change the fake_data stuff to mpi_set_opaque

    * Is it okay to use gettext for the help system?

    * Add some stuff for DU cc

    * use "passphrase" instead of "pass phrase"
    * Use "user ID", "trustdb" and "WARNING".
