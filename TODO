  * Reword the "Not enough entropy" messages.

  * Do we need a configure test for putenv?

  * Check for consistent spelling of user ID, key ID etc.
    Replace "user id not found" in getkey.c by "no valid user ID found".
 
  * Describe some pitfalls when using EGD.  Check that ~/.gnupg/entropy
    really is the default.  What about needed permission?  

  * Using an expired key for signing should give an error message
    "expired key" and not "unusable key'.  Furthermore the error should
    also be thrown when the default key has expired.  Reported by
    Eric.VanBuggenhaut add AdValvas.be.

  * pause scrolling help in --edit-key and elsewhere.

  * getkey does not return revoked/expired keys - therefore it is not
    possible to override it.

  * Selection using +wordlist does not work.
    What about adding a feature -word to the +wordlist search mode.

  * Check the changes to the gpg random gatherer on all W32 platforms.

  * Show more info does not work from edit->trust

  * Check that no secret temporary results are stored in the result parameter
    of the mpi functions.  We have already done this for mpi-mul.c 

  * We need another special packet at the end of a clearsign message to mark
    it's end and allow for multiple signature for one message.  And
    add a real grammar to the code in mainproc.c

  * If there is no secure memory, allocate more memory for the secure
    memory block or do it in all cases.

  * add some minor things vor VMS.

  * Use DSA keys with the test suite (partly done)

  * Fix the bug in the mips assembler code

  * Add a way to show the fingerprint of an key signator's keys

  * Add an is_valid flag to each user ID.

  * Replace the printing of the user name by [self-signature] when
    appropriate so that a key listing does not get clobbered.

  * Concatenated encryption messages don't work corectly - only the
    first one is processed.

  * Add option to put the list of recipients (from the encryption
    layer) into the signatures notation data.

  * --disable-asm should still assemble _udiv_qrnnd when needed

  * Get new assembler stuff from gmp 3.1

  * use DEL and ^H for erasing the previous character (util/ttyio.c).
    or better readline.

  * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)

  * add checking of armor trailers.  Try to detect garbled header lines.

  * the pubkey encrypt functions should do some sanity checks.

  * "gpg filename.tar.gz.asc" should work like --verify (-sab).

  * for messages created with "-t", it might make sense to append the
    verification status of the message to the output (i.e. write something to
    the --output file and not only to stderr.  However the problem is
    that we consider the message transpatrent and don't have any
    indication of the used character set.  To implement this feature
    we need to make sure that all output is plain 7 bit ascii but
    given that we need to print a user name, this does not make sense
    at all.  The only way this can be implemented is by assuming that
    the message is encoded in utf8 and hope tht everyone starts to use
    utf8 instead of latin-1 or whatever RSN.  Hmmm, I myself should
    start with this.

  * keyflags don't distinguish between {certify,signature}-only.

  * Instead of issuing a "signature packet without keyid" gpg should
    try to get the keyID from a corresponding one-pass signature
    packet (See bug report 817).  This is not easy to do as we don't
    store the one-pass packets.

  * cat foo | gpg --sign | gpg --list-packets
    Does not list the signature packet.

  * The description texts passed to the agent should be utf-8 encoded.

Things we won't do
------------------

  * New option --file-remove path-to-wipe-program ?
