    * clearsig: keep lineendings as they are. Remember that trailings
      blanks are not hashed.  Funny: pgp263in works fine even with
      a source file with CR,LF but GnuPG and pgp263in has problems
      if the clearsign has been created by pgp263ia.
      Needs more investigation - anyone?

    * clearsign bug Greg Troxel Jan 11.

    * README does not verify okay. verify inserts an extra CR,LF
      just before "Esoteric Command" (after ~8k of text).

Important
----------
    * Check revocation and expire stuff.  PLEASE: THIS MUST BE TESTED!

    * Check calculation of key validity. PLEASE: IT IS IMPORTED THAT
      THIS GET TESTED.

    * See why we always get this "Hmmm public key lost"

    * print a warning when a revoked/expired secret key is used.

Needed
------
    * remove more "Fixmes"

    * Implement 256 bit key Twofish.

    * Use capabilities if available.


Minor Bugs
----------

    * There is a race condition which leaves lock files after process
      termination (a signal while in make_dotlock).  Change the dotlock
      implementaion to a create handle, make and release implemenation
      and use an atexit to cleanup all pending locks.  This is also
      faster.
    * --list-packets should continue even w/o a passphrase (or in batch
      mode).

Nice to have
------------
    * preferences of hash algorithms are not yet used.
    * new menu to delete signatures and list signature in menu
    * Replace the SIGUSR1 stuff by semaphores to avoid loss of a signal.
      or use POSIX.4 realtime signals.
    * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
      really make sense?
    * change the fake_data stuff to mpi_set_opaque
    * How about letting something like 'gpg --version -v', list the
      effective options. Too much work.
    * Stats about used random numbers.
