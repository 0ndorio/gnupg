Bugs

    * clearsig: keep lineendings as they are. Remember that trailings
      blanks are not hashed.  Funny: pgp263in works fine even with
      a source file with CR,LF but GnuPG and pgp263in has problems
      if the clearsign has been created by pgp263ia.
      Needs more investigation - anyone?

Important
----------
    * Check revocation and expire stuff.  PLEASE: THIS MUST BE TESTED!

    * Check calculation of key validity. PLEASE: IT IS IMPORTED THAT
      THIS GET TESTED.

    * It has been reported that lockfiles are not removed in all cases.
      cleanup is done with atexit() and all signals trigger exit() -
      anything wrong with this?

    * I noticed, that we sometimes have only 3 items in a trustrecord, but
      a next pointer ro more records - check wehther the reuse code really
      works. Maybe this is the reason for the "Hmmm public key lost"

Needed
------
    * remove more "Fixmes"

    * Replace Blowfish by Twofish and add the new encrypted packet typ
      which has a MACing option (append SHA1 hash to the plaintext and
      encrypt this all) - We need an identifier for Twofish to put this
      one into the cipher preferences.

Nice to have
------------
    * preferences of hash algorithms are not yet used.
    * new menu to delete signatures and list signature in menu
    * Replace the SIGUSR1 stuff by semaphores to avoid loss of a signal.
      or use POSIX.4 realtime signals.
    * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
      really make sense?
    * change the fake_data stuff to mpi_set_opaque

Minor Bugs
----------
    * md_start_debug used to crash at pgm termination.
