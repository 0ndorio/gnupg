    * Should we use the ElGamal subkey if the DSA keyid is given?
      What about an option --loose-keyid-match?

    * salted and iterated S2Ks don't work (see passphrase.c).

    * Replace the SIGUSR1 stuff by semaphores to avoid loss of a signal.

    * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)

    * fix the expire stuff for v4 packets.

    * add some sanity checks to read_keyblock, so that we are sure that
     the minimal requirements are met (?)

    * decryption of message with multiple recipients does not work.

    * preferences of hash algorithms are not yet used.

    * rewrite --list-packets or put it into another tool.

    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
      really make sense?

    * Change the buffering to a mbuf like scheme? Need it for PSST anyway.
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * remove all "Fixmes"

    * Change the internal represention of keyid into a struct which
      can also hold the localid and extend the localid to hold information
      of the subkey number because two subkeys may have the same keyid.

    * add an option to re-create a public key from a secret key. Think about
      a backup system of only the secret part of the secret key.

    * OpenBSD has sometimes problems reading from /dev/random.

    * change the fake_data stuff to mpi_set_opaque

    * Is it okay to use gettext for the help system???

    * Add some stuff for DU cc

    * check for "expect" before running test genkey1024

    * use "passphrase" instead of "pass phrase"
    * Use "user ID", "trustdb" and "WARNING".

    * armor.c cannot handle concatenated armored messages.
