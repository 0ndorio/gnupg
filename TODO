  * add some status output put for signing and encryption.
    replace the putc in primegen with some kind of status-fd outputs.

  * Speed up calculation of key validity.

  * print a warning when a revoked/expired _secret_ key is used.

  * Add NO_PUBKEY and NO_SECKEY status lines.

  * Solaris make has problems with the generated POTFILES - seems to be a
    gettext bug.

  * find a way to allow the import of non-self-signed keys.  This is needed
    for the IN ENCR/SIGN hack.


Nice to have
------------
  * Offcial test vectors for 3DES-EDE3
  * use DEL and ^H for erasing the previous character (util/ttyio.c).
    or better readline.
  * Print a warning if the directory mode is wrong.
  * replace the keyserver stuff either by a call to a specialized
    utility and SOCKSify this utility.
  * Do a real fix for bug #7 or document that it is a PGP 5 error.
  * preferences of hash algorithms are not yet used.
  * Replace the SIGUSR1 stuff by semaphores to avoid loss of a signal.
    or use POSIX.4 realtime signals.  Overhaul the interface and the
    test program.  Use it with the test suite?
  * add test cases for invalid data (scrambled armor or other random data)
  * add checking of armor trailers
  * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
    really make sense?	And while we are at it:  implement a secure deletion
    stuff?
  * the pubkey encrypt functions should do some sanity checks.
  * dynload: implement the hint stuff.
  * "gpg filename.tar.gz.asc" should work like --verify (-sab).
  * for messages created with "-t", it might make sense to append the
    verification status of the message to the output (i.e. write something to
    the --output file and not only to stderr.
  * configure option where to find zlib
