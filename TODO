    * add options: --default-signature-user, --default-encryption-user

    * make preferences work

    * rewrite --list-packets or put it into another tool.

    * add field to PKT_user_id to hold the hash context

    * add usage arguments to get_key_byname or return a PKC_LIST with
      all keys and add a selection.

    * add readline support. Must enhance libreadline - Anyone?

    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2).

    * enable a SIGSEGV handler while using zlib functions

    * improve iobuf by reading more than one byte at once,
      this shoud espceially done for the buffer in the chain.
      Change the buffering to a mbuf like scheme? Need it for PSST anyway.
    * add a way to distinguish between errors and eof in the underflow/flush
      function of iobuf.
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * remove all "Fixmes"

    * bug: g10/trustdb.c#build_sigrecs called to often by do_list_path
      and remove the bad kludge. Maybe we should put all sigs into the trustdb
      and mark them as valid/invalid/nopubkey, and how do we check, that
      we have a self-signature -> put this stuff into a kind of directory
      record, as it does not belong to the pubkey record?

    * add an option to create a new user id.

    * add an option to re-create a public key from a secret key. Think about
      a backup system of only the secret part of the secret key.

    * add fingerprint/keyid hashing. We need a new field in PKC to
      flag that we may have a cached signature for this (and use the address
      of PKC to lookup the hash).

    * replace getkey.c#enum_secret_keys
