    * Change the internal represenation of keyid into a struct which
      can also hold the localid and extend the localid to hold information
      of the subkey number because two subkeys may have the same keyid.

    * invalid packets (Marco)

    * add some sanity checks to read_keyblock, so that we are sure that
    the minimal requirements are met (?)

    * what about the CR,LF in cleartext singatures?

    * add option --restore-ownertrust

    * always put key signatures before the first subkey.

    * add a way to delete subkeys (in edit-keys?)

    * make preferences work

    * rewrite --list-packets or put it into another tool.

    * add usage arguments to get_key_byname or return a PKC_LIST with
      all keys and add a selection.

    * add readline support. Must enhance libreadline - Anyone?

    * Burn the buffers used by fopen(), or use read(2). Does this
      really make sense?

    * enable a SIGSEGV handler while using zlib functions

    * Change the buffering to a mbuf like scheme? Need it for PSST anyway.
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * remove all "Fixmes"

    * bug: g10/trustdb.c#build_sigrecs called to often by do_list_path
      and remove the bad kludge. Maybe we should put all sigs into the trustdb
      and mark them as valid/invalid/nopubkey, and how do we check, that
      we have a self-signature -> put this stuff into a kind of directory
      record, as it does not belong to the pubkey record?

    * add an option to create a new user id.

    * add an option to re-create a public key from a secret key. Think about
      a backup system of only the secret part of the secret key.

    * replace getkey.c#enum_secret_keys
