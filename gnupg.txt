%%name: GnuPG

%%short-description: Complete implementation of the OpenPGP Internet standard.

%%full-description: A complete and free replacement for PGP. The
program does not use any patented algorithms, and can be used as a
filter program. Can handle all OpenPGP messages and messages generated
by PGP 5.0 and later.

Supports ElGamal (signature and encrytion), DSA, AES, 3DES, Blowfish,
Twofish, CAST5, IDEA, MD5, SHA-1, RIPE-MD-160, and has language
support for sixteen different languages.

It is believed to be fully OpenPGP (as defined in RFC2440) conform,
and has integrated support for HKP keyservers. There are a lot of
useful extra features like anonymous message recipients.
