Noteworthy changes in version 2.1.0 (2014-11-06)
------------------------------------------------

 This release introduces a lot of changes.  Most of them are internal
 and thus not user visible.  However, some long standing behavior has
 slightly changed and it is strongly suggested that an existing
 "~/.gnupg" directory is backed up before this version is used.

 A verbose description of the major new features and changes can be
 found in the file doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt.

 * gpg: All support for v3 (PGP 2) keys has been dropped.  All
   signatures are now created as v4 signatures.  v3 keys will be
   removed from the keyring.

 * gpg: With pinentry-0.9.0 the passphrase "enter again" prompt shows
   up in the same window as the "new passphrase" prompt.

 * gpg: Allow importing keys with duplicated long key ids.

 * dirmngr: May now be build without support for LDAP.

 * For a complete list of changes see the lists of changes for the
   2.1.0 beta versions below.  Note that all relevant fixes from
   versions 2.0.14 to 2.0.26 are also applied to this version.

   fix).

 * tools: gpg-connect-agent does now proberly display the help output
   for "SCD HELP" commands.


 [Noteworthy changes in version 2.1.0beta2 (2011-03-08)]

 * gpg: ECC support as described by draft-jivsov-openpgp-ecc-06.txt
   [Update: now known as RFC-6637].

 * gpg: Print "AES128" instead of "AES".  This change introduces a
   little incompatibility for tools using "gpg --list-config".  We
   hope that these tools are written robust enough to accept this new
   algorithm name as well.

 * gpgsm: New feature to create certificates from a parameter file.
   Add prompt to the --gen-key UI to create self-signed certificates.

 * agent: TMPDIR is now also honored when creating a socket using

   we now have a specified direct interface to keyservers via Dirmngr.
   LDAP, DNS and mail backends are not yet implemented.

 * Fixed TTY management for pinentries and session variable update
   problem.


 [Noteworthy changes in version 2.1.0beta1 (2010-10-26)]

 * gpg: secring.gpg is not anymore used but all secret key operations
   are delegated to gpg-agent.  The import command moves secret keys
   to the agent.

   certificates in the chain except for the root certificate.

 * gpgsm: New option --ignore-cert-extension.

 * g13: The G13 tool for disk encryption key management has been
   added.

 * agent: If the agent's --use-standard-socket option is active, all
   tools try to start and daemonize the agent on the fly.  In the past
   this was only supported on W32; on non-W32 systems the new
   configure option --disable-standard-socket may now be used to
   disable this new default.

 * agent: New and changed passphrases are now created with an
   iteration count requiring about 100ms of CPU work.

 * dirmngr: Dirmngr is now a part of this package.  It is now also
   expected to run as a system service and the configuration
   directories are changed to the GnuPG name space. [Update: 2.1.0
   starts dirmngr on demand as user daemon.]

 * Add hack to the internal CCID driver to allow the use of some
   Omnikey based card readers with 2048 bit keys.

 * GPG now repeatly asks the user to insert the requested OpenPGP
   card.  This can be disabled with --limit-card-insert-tries=1.

 * Minor bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.12 (2009-06-17)
-------------------------------------------------

 * GPGSM now always lists ephemeral certificates if specified by
   fingerprint or keygrip.

 * New command "KEYINFO" for GPG_AGENT.  GPGSM now also returns
   information about smartcards.

 * SCDAEMON is now aware of the Geldkarte.

 * The SCDAEMON option --allow-admin is now used by default.

 * GPGCONF now restarts SCdaemon if necessary.

 * The default cipher algorithm in GPGSM is now again 3DES.  This is

   can't cope with AES.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.10 (2009-01-12)
-------------------------------------------------

 * [gpg] New keyserver helper gpg2keys_kdns as generic DNS CERT

 * Allow encryption with legacy Elgamal sign+encrypt keys with option
   --rfc2440.

 * Windows is now a supported platform.

 * Made sure that under Windows the file permissions of the socket are
   taken into account.  This required a change of our socket emulation
   code and changed the IPC protocol under Windows.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.7 (2007-09-10)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed encryption problem if duplicate certificates are in the
   keybox.

 * Made it work on Windows Vista.  Note that the entire Windows port
   is still considered Beta.

 * Add new options min-passphrase-nonalpha, check-passphrase-pattern,
   enforce-passphrase-constraints and max-passphrase-days to
   gpg-agent.

 * Add command --check-components to gpgconf.  Gpgconf now uses the

------------------------------------------------

 * The server mode key listing commands are now also working for
   systems without the funopen/fopencookie API.

 * PKCS#12 import now tries several encodings in case the passphrase
   was not utf-8 encoded.  New option --p12-charset for gpgsm.

 * Improved the libgcrypt logging support in all modules.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.3 (2007-03-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * By default, do not allow processing multiple plaintexts in a single
   stream.  Many programs that called GnuPG were assuming that GnuPG
   did not permit this, and were thus not using the plaintext boundary
   status tags that GnuPG provides.  This change makes GnuPG reject
   such messages by default which makes those programs safe again.
   --allow-multiple-messages returns to the old behavior. [CVE-2007-1263].

 * New --verify-option show-primary-uid-only.

 * gpgconf may now reads a global configuration file to select which
   options are changeable by a frontend.  The new applygnupgdefaults
   tool may be used by an admin to set default options for all users.

 * Fixed a serious and exploitable bug in processing encrypted
   packages. [CVE-2006-6235].

 * Added --passphrase-repeat to set the number of times GPG will
   prompt for a new passphrase to be repeated.  This is useful to help
   memorize a new passphrase.  The default is 1 repetition.

 * Using a PIN pad does now also work for the signing key.

 * A warning is displayed by gpg-agent if a new passphrase is too
   short.  New option --min-passphrase-len defaults to 8.

 * The status code BEGIN_SIGNING now shows the used hash algorithms.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.1 (2006-11-28)
------------------------------------------------

 * Experimental support for the PIN pads of the SPR 532 and the Kaan
   Advanced card readers.  Add "disable-keypad" scdaemon.conf if you
   don't want it.  Does currently only work for the OpenPGP card and
   its authentication and decrypt keys.

 * Fixed build problems on some some platforms and crashes on amd64.

 * Fixed a buffer overflow in gpg2. [bug#728,CVE-2006-6169]

 * The gpg code from 1.4.5 has been fully merged into this release.
   The configure option --enable-gpg is still required to build this
   gpg part.  For production use of OpenPGP the gpg version 1.4.5 is
   still recommended.  Note, that gpg will be installed under the name
   gpg2 to allow coexisting with an 1.4.x gpg.

 * API change in gpg-agent's pkdecrypt command.  Thus an older gpgsm
   may not be used with the current gpg-agent.

 * The scdaemon will now call a script on reader status changes.

 * gpgsm now allows file descriptor passing for "INPUT", "OUTPUT" and
   "MESSAGE".

   commands.

 * Internal changes for OpenPGP cards. New Assuan command WRITEKEY.

 * GNU Pth is now a hard requirement.

 * [scdaemon] Support for OpenSC has been removed.  Instead a new and
   straightforward pkcs#15 modules has been written.  As of now it
   does allows only signing using TCOS cards but we are going to
   enhance it to match all the old capabilities.

   to use the pinentry as well as the OpenPGP smartcard with ssh.

 * New tool gpg-connect-agent as a general client for the gpg-agent.

 * New tool symcryptrun as a wrapper for certain encryption tools.

-------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a serious bug in the checking of trusted root certificates.

 * New configure option --enable-agent-pnly allows to build and
   install just the agent.

   allow gpg-agent to add a key to the trustlist.txt after user
   confirmation.

 * Creating PKCS#10 requests does now honor the key usage.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.8 (2004-04-29)

------------------------------------------------

 * Instrumented the modules for gpgconf.

------------------------------------------------

 * Code cleanups and bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.5 (2004-02-21)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpg-protect-tool gets now installed into libexec as it ought to be.
   Cleaned up the build system to better comply with the coding
   standards.

 * [gpgsm] The --import command is now able to autodetect pkcs#12
   files and import secret and private keys from this file format.
   A new command --export-secret-key-p12 is provided to allow
   exporting of secret keys in PKCS\#12 format.

 * [gpgsm] The pinentry will now present a description of the key for
   whom the passphrase is requested.

 * [gpgsm] New option --with-validation to check the validity of key
   while listing it.

------------------------------------------------

 * Added support for the Telesec NKS 2.0 card application.

 * Added simple tool addgnupghome to create .gnupg directories from
   /etc/skel/.gnupg.

 * Various minor bug fixes and cleanups; mainly gpgsm and gpg-agent
   related.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.3 (2003-12-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * New gpgsm options --{enable,disable}-ocsp to validate keys using
   OCSP. This option requires a not yet released DirMngr version.
   Default is disabled.

 * The --log-file option may now be used to print logs to a socket.
   Prefix the socket name with "socket://" to enable this.  This does
   not work on all systems and falls back to stderr if there is a
   problem with the socket.

 * The options --encrypt-to and --no-encrypt-to now work the same in
   gpgsm as in gpg.  Note, they are also used in server mode.

 * Duplicated recipients are now silently removed in gpgsm.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.2 (2003-11-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * On card key generation is no longer done using the --gen-key
   command but from the menu provided by the new --card-edit command.

 * PINs are now properly cached and there are only 2 PINs visible.
   The 3rd PIN (CHV2) is internally syncronized with the regular PIN.

 * All kind of other internal stuff.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.1 (2003-09-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Support for OpenSC is back. scdaemon supports a --disable-opensc to
   disable OpenSC use at runtime, so that PC/SC or ct-API can still be
   used directly.

 * Rudimentary support for the SCR335 smartcard reader using an
   internal driver.  Requires current libusb from CVS.

 * Bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.0 (2003-08-05)
------------------------------------------------

      ====== PLEASE SEE README-alpha =======

 * gpg has been renamed to gpg2 and gpgv to gpgv2.  This is a
   temporary change to allow co-existing with stable gpg versions.

 * ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-1.9.0 is fist tried as config file before the
   usual gpg.conf.

 * Removed the -k, -kv and -kvv commands.  -k is now an alias to
   --list-keys.  New command -K as alias for --list-secret-keys.

 * Removed --run-as-shm-coprocess feature.

 * gpg does now also use libgcrypt, libgpg-error is required.

 * New gpgsm commands --call-dirmngr and --call-protect-tool.

 * Changing a passphrase is now possible using "gpgsm --passwd"

 * The content-type attribute is now recognized and created.

 * The agent does now reread certain options on receiving a HUP.

 * The pinentry is now forked for each request so that clients with
   different environments are supported.  When running in daemon mode
   and --keep-display is not used the DISPLAY variable is ignored.

 * Merged stuff from the newpg branch and started this new
   development branch.
