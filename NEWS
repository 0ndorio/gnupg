Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.0 (unreleased)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpg has been renamed to gpg2 and gpgv to gpgv2.  This is a
   temporary solution to allow co-existing with stable gpg versions.

 * The default config file is ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-1.9.0 if it exists.

 * Removed the -k, -kv and -kvv commands.  -k is now an alias to
   --list-keys.  New command -K as alias for --list-secret-keys.

 * Removed --run-as-shm-coprocess feature.

 * gpg does now also use libgcrypt, libgpg-error is required.

 * New gpgsm commands --call-dirmngr and --call-protect-tool.

 * Changing a passphrase is now possible using "gpgsm --passwd"

 * The content-type attribute is now recognized and created.

 * The agent does now reread certain options on receiving a HUP.

 * The pinentry is now forked for each request so that clients with
   different environments are supported.  When running in daemon mode
   and --keep-display is not used the DISPLAY variable is ignored.

 * Merged stuff from the newpg branch and started this new
   development branch.
