Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.9
------------------------------------------------



Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.8 (2004-04-29)
------------------------------------------------

 * [scdaemon] Overhauled the internal CCID driver.

 * [scdaemon] Status files named ~/.gnupg/reader_<n>.status are now
   written when using the internal CCID driver.

 * [gpgsm] New commands --dump-{,secret,external}-keys to show a very
   detailed view of the certificates.

 * The keybox gets now compressed after 3 hours and ephemeral
   stored certificates are deleted after about a day.

 * [gpg] Usability fixes for --card-edit.  Note, that this has already
   been ported back to gnupg-1.3


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.7 (2004-04-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Instrumented the modules for gpgconf.

 * Added support for DINSIG card applications.

 * Include the smimeCapabilities attribute with signed messages.

 * Now uses the gettext domain "gnupg2" to avoid conflicts with gnupg
   versions < 1.9.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.6 (2004-03-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Code cleanups and bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.5 (2004-02-21)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpg-protect-tool gets now installed into libexec as it ought to be.
   Cleaned up the build system to better comply with the coding
   standards.

 * [gpgsm] The --import command is now able to autodetect pkcs#12
   files and import secret and private keys from this file format.
   A new command --export-secret-key-p12 is provided to allow
   exporting of secret keys in PKCS\#12 format.

 * [gpgsm] The pinentry will now present a description of the key for
   whom the passphrase is requested.

 * [gpgsm] New option --with-validation to check the validity of key
   while listing it.

 * New option --debug-level={none,basic,advanced,expert,guru} to map
   the debug flags to sensitive levels on a per program base.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.4 (2004-01-30)
------------------------------------------------

 * Added support for the Telesec NKS 2.0 card application.

 * Added simple tool addgnupghome to create .gnupg directories from
   /etc/skel/.gnupg.

 * Various minor bug fixes and cleanups; mainly gpgsm and gpg-agent
   related.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.3 (2003-12-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * New gpgsm options --{enable,disable}-ocsp to validate keys using
   OCSP. This option requires a not yet released DirMngr version.
   Default is disabled.

 * The --log-file option may now be used to print logs to a socket.
   Prefix the socket name with "socket://" to enable this.  This does
   not work on all systems and falls back to stderr if there is a
   problem with the socket.

 * The options --encrypt-to and --no-encrypt-to now work the same in
   gpgsm as in gpg.  Note, they are also used in server mode.

 * Duplicated recipients are now silently removed in gpgsm.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.2 (2003-11-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * On card key generation is no longer done using the --gen-key
   command but from the menu provided by the new --card-edit command.

 * PINs are now properly cached and there are only 2 PINs visible.
   The 3rd PIN (CHV2) is internally syncronized with the regular PIN.

 * All kind of other internal stuff.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.1 (2003-09-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Support for OpenSC is back. scdaemon supports a --disable-opensc to
   disable OpenSC use at runtime, so that PC/SC or ct-API can still be
   used directly.

 * Rudimentary support for the SCR335 smartcard reader using an
   internal driver.  Requires current libusb from CVS.

 * Bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.0 (2003-08-05)
------------------------------------------------

      ====== PLEASE SEE README-alpha =======

 * gpg has been renamed to gpg2 and gpgv to gpgv2.  This is a
   temporary change to allow co-existing with stable gpg versions.

 * ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-1.9.0 is fist tried as config file before the
   usual gpg.conf.

 * Removed the -k, -kv and -kvv commands.  -k is now an alias to
   --list-keys.  New command -K as alias for --list-secret-keys.

 * Removed --run-as-shm-coprocess feature.

 * gpg does now also use libgcrypt, libgpg-error is required.

 * New gpgsm commands --call-dirmngr and --call-protect-tool.

 * Changing a passphrase is now possible using "gpgsm --passwd"

 * The content-type attribute is now recognized and created.

 * The agent does now reread certain options on receiving a HUP.

 * The pinentry is now forked for each request so that clients with
   different environments are supported.  When running in daemon mode
   and --keep-display is not used the DISPLAY variable is ignored.

 * Merged stuff from the newpg branch and started this new
   development branch.
