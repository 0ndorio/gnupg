~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[  *] #1
    pgp263in works fine even with a source file with CR,LF but GnuPG
    and pgp263in has problems if the clearsign has been created by
    pgp263ia.

[  *] #3
    --list-packets should continue even w/o a passphrase (or in batch
    mode).  Maybe we have to move it to a separate program??

[  *] #4  1999-01-13 <ralf.stephan@fitug.de> 0.9.1
    v3 key 'expiration date' problem:
       1. generate a key, set expiration date
       2. <do other things, deleting etc.>
       3. edit a v3 secret key, try to set expiration date
       - output: "You can't change...
       4. save
       5. key has expiration date from 1. and gpg reports that pubkey
	  and seckey differ.
     The for loop the exp.date is set before v3 detection?
     [is this bug still there?]

[  *] #5
    /home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: can't open gdbm file: Can't be writer
    keyblock resource `/home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg': file open error
    OOPS in close enum_keyblocks - ignored
    [gdbm is experimental and will be replaced by the new keybox code]

[***] #6 1999-02-22 <backes@rhrk.uni-kl.de> 0.9.3
    Buserror on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while creating
    the prime.	Other buserrors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
    on sparc-solaris2.6.
    --> Solaris fixed.
    --> IRIX bug still there


[  *] #13 1999-04-05
    Trying to generate very large keys fails with a BUG in read_pool()


[  *] #14 1999-04-05 <anonymous>
    If you have the following lines in your "options" file:
      load-extension twofish
      cipher-algo twofish
      s2k-cipher-algo twofish
    and then try to "gpg --gen-key", everything goes along fine until you
    verify your password. Then the program crashes with a BUG at line 226
    of passphrase.c.


[ **] #15 199-04-05
    Hash calculation for subkey bindings is not according to rfc2440 if
    a 4 byte length header is used for the subkey.


Next #16
