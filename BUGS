This following list contains those bugs which we are aware of.	Please
make sure that bugs you report are not listed here.  If you can fix one
of these bugs/limitations we will certainly be glad to receive a patch.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[  *] #1
    pgp263in works fine even with a source file with CR,LF but GnuPG
    and pgp263in has problems if the clearsign has been created by
    pgp263ia.

[  *] #3
    --list-packets should continue even w/o a passphrase (or in batch
    mode).  Maybe we have to move it to a separate program??

[  *] #4  1999-01-13 <ralf.stephan@fitug.de> 0.9.1
    v3 key 'expiration date' problem:
       1. generate a key, set expiration date
       2. <do other things, deleting etc.>
       3. edit a v3 secret key, try to set expiration date
       - output: "You can't change...
       4. save
       5. key has expiration date from 1. and gpg reports that pubkey
	  and seckey differ.
     The for loop the exp.date is set before v3 detection?
     [is this bug still there?]

[  *] #5
    /home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: can't open gdbm file: Can't be writer
    keyblock resource `/home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg': file open error
    OOPS in close enum_keyblocks - ignored
    [gdbm is experimental and will be replaced by the new keybox code]

[***] #6 1999-02-22 <backes@rhrk.uni-kl.de> 0.9.3
    Buserror on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while creating
    the prime.	Other buserrors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
    on sparc-solaris2.6.
    --> I hope I've fixed this: Please, can someone it. I can't reproduce it
	on the alpha I have access to.

[ **] #7 1999-02-22 <dwpalmer@dwpalm.jf.intel.com> 0.9.3
    Conventional encrytion incompatibilty:
     $ gpg -c --cipher-algo cast5 --compress-algo 1 --no-comment secrets.txt
    Creates a file that gpg can decrypt, but PGP 5.5 has problems with it.
    PGP decrypts 6416k out of 6424k, then complains with "PGP Warning",
    "The keyring contains a bad (corrupted) PGP packet".  The resulting
    file is missing information from the front.

[  *] #8 1999-02-25 <kazu@iijlab.net>
    %gpg --encrypt -r kazu@iijlab.net --batch foo
    gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
    gpg: 11C23F61: no info to calculate a trust probability

    This creates a symmetrically encrypted message WITHOUT a session key
    encrypted with public cryptographic(i.e. foo.gpg). This is probably
    because GNUPG encrypted a message with a random session key first then
    tries to find public keys specified with the -r option. I don't like
    this.
