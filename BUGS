~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[  *] #3
    --list-packets should continue even w/o a passphrase (or in batch
    mode).  Maybe we have to move it to a separate program??

[  *] #4  1999-01-13 <ralf.stephan@fitug.de> 0.9.1
    v3 key 'expiration date' problem:
       1. generate a key, set expiration date
       2. <do other things, deleting etc.>
       3. edit a v3 secret key, try to set expiration date
       - output: "You can't change...
       4. save
       5. key has expiration date from 1. and gpg reports that pubkey
	  and seckey differ.
     The for loop the exp.date is set before v3 detection?
     [is this bug still alive?]

[  *] #5
    /home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: can't open gdbm file: Can't be writer
    keyblock resource `/home/jam/.gnupg/pubring.gpg': file open error
    OOPS in close enum_keyblocks - ignored
    [gdbm is experimental and will be replaced by the new keybox code]

[***] #6 1999-02-22 <backes@rhrk.uni-kl.de> 0.9.3
    Buserror on IRIX 6.4: Crash while doing a keygen. I think while creating
    the prime.	Other buserrors are reported when doing a "gpg README"
    on sparc-solaris2.6.
    --> Solaris fixed.
    --> IRIX bug still there

[  *] #18 1999-05-27 <Steffen.Zahn@icn.siemens.de> 0.9.7
    rndunix hangs on hp/ux.  The problme is related to my_plcose which is
    not always called.	(I suggest to use EGD instead of rndunix.)

[ **] #19 1999-06-11
    "trustdb transaction too large" with about 500 signatures on a key
    FAEBD5FC.


Next #20
