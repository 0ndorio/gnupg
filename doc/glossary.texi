@item ARL
      The @emph{Authority Revocation List} is technical identical to a
@acronym{CRL} but used for @acronym{CA}s and not for end user
certificates.

@item CRL
     The @emph{Certificate Revocation List} is a list containing
certificates revoked by the issuer.

@item Keygrip
      This term is used by GnuPG to describe a 20 byte hash value used
to identify a certain key without referencing to a concrete protocol.
It is used internally to access a private key.  Usually it is shown and
entered as a 40 character hexadecimal formatted string.

@item OCSP
      The @emph{Online Certificate Status Protocol} is used as an
alternative to a @acronym{CRL}.  It is described in @code{RFC 2560}.
