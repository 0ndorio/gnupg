@chapter A short installation guide.

[to be written]

Tell how to setup the system, install certificates, how dirmngr relates
to GnuPG etc.

** Explain how to setup a root CA key as trusted

X.509 is based on a hierarchical key infrastructure.  At the root of the
tree a trusted anchor (root certificate) is required.  There are usually
no other means of verfying whether this root certificate is trutsworthy
than looking it up in a list. GnuPG uses a file (@file{trustlist.txt})
to keep track of all root certificates it knows about.  There are 3 ways
to get certificates into this list:

@itemize
@item
Use the list which comes with GnuPG. However this list only
contains a few root certifciates.  Most installations will need more.

@item
Let @command{gpgsm} ask you whether you want to insert a new root
certificate.  To enable this feature you need to set the option
@option{allow-mark-trusted} into @file{gpg-agent.conf}.  In general it
is not a good idea to do it this way.  Checking whether a root
certificate is really trustworthy requires a decsions, which casual
usuers are not up to.  Thus, by default this option is not enabled.

@item 
Manually maintain the list of trusted root certificates. For a multi
user installation this can be done once for all users on a machine.
Specific changes on a per-user base are also possible.

XXX decribe how to maintain trustlist.txt and /etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt.
