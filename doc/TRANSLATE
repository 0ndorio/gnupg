Note for translators
--------------------

Some strings in GnuPG are for matching user input against.  These
strings can accept multiple values that mean essentially the same
thing.

For example, the string "yes" in English is "sí" in Spanish.  However,
some users will type "si" (without the accent).  To accomodate both
users, you can translate the string "yes" as "sí|si".  You can have
any number of alternate matches seperated by the | character like
"sí|si|seguro".

The strings that can be handled in this way are of the form "yes|yes",
(or "no|no", etc.) There should also be a comment in the .po file
directing you to this file.
