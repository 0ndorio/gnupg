# Note that this help file needs to be UTF-8 encoded.  When looking
# for a help item, GnuPG scans the help files in the following order
# (assuming a GNU or Unix system):
#
#    /etc/gnupg/help.LL_TT.txt
#    /etc/gnupg/help.LL.txt
#    /etc/gnupg/help.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/help.LL_TT.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/help.LL.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/help.txt
#    
# Here LL_TT denotes the full name of the current locale with the
# territory (.e.g. "de_DE"), LL denotes just the locale name
# (e.g. "de").  The first matching item is returned.  To put a dot or
# a hash mark at the beginning of a help text line, it needs to be
# prefixed with ". ".  A single dot may be used to terminated ahelp
# entry.

.#pinentry.qualitybar.tooltip
# [remove the hash mark from the key to enable this text]
# This entry is just an example on how to customize the tooltip shown
# when hovering over the quality bar of the pinentry.  We don't
# install this text so that the hardcoded translation takes
# precedence.  An administrator should write up a short help to tell
# the users about the configured passphrase constraints and save that
# to /etc/gnupg/help.txt.
This bar indicates the quality of the passphrase entered above.  

As long as the bar is shown in red, GnuPG considers the passphrase too
weak to accept.  Please ask your administrator for details about the
configured passphrase constraints.
