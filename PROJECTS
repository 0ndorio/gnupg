  * abstraction of the MPI

  * Add a way to override the current cipher/md implementations
    by others (using extensions)

  * add a fast-import command which does not do the signature checks
    of other keys (processing of the sdir hintlist).  The signatures
    may then be verified by a maintainence pass.
