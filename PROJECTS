  * Urko Lusa <ulusa@lacueva.ddns.org> is working on es.po


  * Check if an object (a message, detached sign, public key, or whatever)
    is signed by definite user, i.e. define user
    (userid, or any other unique identification) on command line.


  * abstraction of the MPI

  * Add a way to override the current cipher/md implementations
    by others (using extensions)

  * add a fast-import command which does not do the signature checks
    of other keys (processing of the sdir hintlist).  The signatures
    may then be verified by a maintainence pass.

  * Not GnupG replated:  What about option completion in bash?
    Can "--dump-options" be used for this or should we place the
    options in a special ELF segment?
