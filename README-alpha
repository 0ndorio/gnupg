The 1.1 series are the current development branch of GnuPG.

       DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

        THERE MIGHT EVEN BE SECURITY PROBLEMS!

The source may change quite often and may have serious
problems; it may even not compile on some machines.

It will probably need GCC and GLIBC to build due to
some debugging code.  Please don't complain if it does not 
work on other machines.  We will make it work again later.

Use GnuPG from the stable 1.0.x series for real work.

If you are looking for the CVS from the stable tree, use 

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnupg.org:/cvs/gnupg co -r STABLE-BRANCH-1-0 gnupg
