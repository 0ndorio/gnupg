	verification.  Add OUT_FP arg, initialize a writer and changed all

	* Makefile.am: Use the LIBGCRYPT and LIBKSBA variables.

	* fingerprint.c (gpgsm_get_keygrip): Use the new
	gcry_pk_get_keygrip to calculate the grip - note the algorithm and
	therefore the grip values changed.

2001-12-15  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* certcheck.c (gpgsm_check_cms_signature): Removed the faked-key
	kludge.
	(gpgsm_create_cms_signature): Removed the commented fake key
	code.  This makes the function pretty simple.

	* sign.c (gpgsm_sign): Ditto.

	* base64.c (base64_reader_cb): Reset the linelen when we need to

	(cmd_import): Close the FDs on success.
	(close_message_fd): New.
	(input_notify): Setting autodetect_encoding to 0 after initializing

	possible to attach gdb when used in server mode.

	* sign.c (get_default_signer): Use keydb_classify_name here.

	* call-agent.c (LINELENGTH): Removed.
	(gpgsm_agent_pksign): Use ASSUAN_LINELENGTH, not LINELENGTH.
	(gpgsm_agent_pkdecrypt): Likewise.

	and a few other values.

2001-12-12  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* gpgsm.c (main): New options --assume-{armor,base64,binary}.
