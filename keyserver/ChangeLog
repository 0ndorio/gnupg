	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Use the new OUTOFBAND indicator so gpg knows
	not to try and import anything.  Also turn on perl -w for
	warnings.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): If we're using temp files (rather than
	stdin/stdout), make sure the file is closed when we're done.

	* Properly free the LDAP response when we're done with it.

	* Now that we handle multiple keys, we must remove duplicates as
	the LDAP keyserver returns keys with multiple user IDs multiple
	times.

	* Properly handle multiple keys with the same key ID (it's really
	rare, so fetch "0xDEADBEEF" to test this).

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c, gpgkeys_mailto.in: Fix GNU capitalization
	issues.  Prefix log messages with "gpgkeys" to clarify which
	program is generating them.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (search_key): Use unsigned int rather than uint
	for portability.

	* Initial version of gpgkeys_ldap (LDAP keyserver helper) and
	gpgkeys_mailto (email keyserver helper)
