	* gpgkeys_ldap (get_key): LDAP keyservers do not support v3
	fingerprints, so error out if someone tries.  Actually, they don't
	support any fingerprints, but at least we can calculate a keyid
	from a v4 fingerprint.

	* gpgkeys_ldap: Clarify the notion of a partial failure.  This is
	possible if more than one key is being handled in a batch, and one
	fails while the other succeeds.  Note that a search that comes up
	with no results is not a failure - that is a valid response of "no
	answer".

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (get_key): Allow GnuPG to send us full v4
	fingerprints, long key ids, or short key ids while fetching.
	Since the LDAP server doesn't actually handle fingerprints, chop
	them down to long key ids for actual use.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main, get_key): When searching for a keyid,
	search for subkeys as well as primary keys.  This is mostly
	significant when automatically fetching the key based on the id in
	a header (i.e. "signature made by....").  "no-include-subkeys"
	disables.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Fix compiler warning.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c: Be much more robust with mangled input files.

	* gpgkeys_mailto.in: Use the new OUTOFBAND indicator so gpg knows
	not to try and import anything.  Also turn on perl -w for
	warnings.

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (main): If we're using temp files (rather than
	stdin/stdout), make sure the file is closed when we're done.

	* Properly free the LDAP response when we're done with it.

	* Now that we handle multiple keys, we must remove duplicates as
	the LDAP keyserver returns keys with multiple user IDs multiple
	times.

	* Properly handle multiple keys with the same key ID (it's really
	rare, so fetch "0xDEADBEEF" to test this).

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c, gpgkeys_mailto.in: Fix GNU capitalization
	issues.  Prefix log messages with "gpgkeys" to clarify which
	program is generating them.

2001-12-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgkeys_ldap.c (search_key): Use unsigned int rather than uint
	for portability.

	* Initial version of gpgkeys_ldap (LDAP keyserver helper) and
	gpgkeys_mailto (email keyserver helper)
