# This is a sample option file
#
# Unless you you specify which option file to use with the
# commandline option "--options filename", gpg uses the
# file ~/.gnupg/options by default.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in GNUPG. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# Here is a list of all possible options. Not of all them make
# sense in an option file; consider this as a complete option
# reference. Before the options you find a list of commands.


#-----------------------------------------------
#------------------- Commands ------------------
#-----------------------------------------------
# With some exceptions, these cannot be combined

print-md algo
# print the message digest of algorithm ALGO for stdin or all
# given filenames

print-mds
# print all message digests of all give filenames

sign-key
store
# simply packs the input data into a rfc1991 packet format

list-secret-keys
#

export-secret-keys
# export secret keys (which may be usefuil in some cases)

check-trustdb







#-----------------------------------------------
#--- options
#-----------------------------------------------

compress-keys
# compress exported key, compress level is still set with "-z" and
# algorithm with --compress-algo" - Default is to not compress keys, as
# this is better for interoperability.

compress-sigs
# Normally, compressing of signatures does not make sense; so this
# is disabled for detached signatures unless this option is used.
