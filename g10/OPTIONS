# This is a sample option file
#
# Unless you you specify which option file to use with the
# commandline option "--options filename", gpg uses per
# default the file ~/.gnupg/options.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in GNUPG. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# Here is a list of all possible options. Not of all them make
# sense in an option file; consider this as a complete option
# reference. Before the options you find a list of commands.

# With one argument:  take it as the bitsize and make a simple prime of
#		      this size
# With two arguments: Generate a prime, usable for DL algorithms.
# With three arguments: same as above, but a third argument indicates
#			that a generator should also be calculated.
