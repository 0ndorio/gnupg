# This is a sample option file
#
# Unless you you specify which option file to use with the
# commandline option "--options filename", g10 uses per
# default the file ~/.g10/options.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in G10. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# Here is a list of all possible options. Not of all them make
# sense in an option file; consider this as a complete option
# reference

add-key
# add key to the public keyring

armor
# create ascii armored output


batch
# batch mode: never ask

cache-all
# hold everything in memory

change-passphrase
# change the passphrase of your secret keyring

check
# check a signature

check-key
# check signatures on a key in the keyring

debug  value|hexvalue
#  set debugging flags,

debug-all
# enable full debugging

decrypt
# decrypt data (default)

delete-key
# remove key from public keyring,

detach-sign
# make a detached signature,

dry-run
# don't make any changes

encrypt
# encrypt data

fingerprint
# show the fingerprints,

gen-key
# generate a new key pair,

gen-prime
# Generate a prime.
# With one argument:  take it as the bitsize and make a simple prime of
#		      this size
# With two arguments: Generate a prime, usable for DL algorithms.
# With three arguments: same as above, but a third argument indicates
#			taht a generator should also be calculated.

keyring  filename
# add this filename to the list of keyrings

local-user user-string
#  use this user-string to sign or decrypt

no
# assume no on most questions

no-armor
# Assume the input data is not in ascii armored format.

no-default-keyring
# Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings

options filename
#  Ignored in option files.

output filename
# use filename for output

print-mds
# print all message digests of all give filenames

remote-user
# use this user-id for encryption"


secret-keyring filename
# add filename to the list of secret keyrings

sign
# make a signature

sign-key
# make a signature on a key in the keyring
# Argument is the userid of the key to sign.
# This looks for the key, displays the key and checks all
# existing signatures of this key. If the key is not yet signed
# by the default user (or the users given with "-l"), the programm
# displays the information of the key again, together with
# it's fingerprint and asked wehter it should be signed. This question
# is repeated for all users specified with "-l".  The key is then signed
# and the keyring which contains the key is updated.

store
# simply packs the input data into a rfc1991 packet format

symmetric
# encrypt the input only with the symmetric (conventional) cipher.
# This asks for a passphrase.

test
# Used for testing some parts of the program

verbose
# Give more informations suring processing. If used 2 times, the input data
# is listed in detail.

yes
# assume yes on most questions
