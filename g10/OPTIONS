# This is a sample option file
#
# Unless you you specify which option file to use with the
# commandline option "--options filename", g10 uses per
# default the file ~/.g10/options.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in G10. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# Here is a list of all possible options. Not of all them make
# sense in an option file; consider this as a complete option
# reference. Before the options you find a list of commands.


#-----------------------------------------------
#------------------- Commands ------------------
#-----------------------------------------------
# With some expections, those cannot be combined

add-key
# add key to the public keyring

change-passphrase
# change the passphrase of your secret keyring

check
# check a signature

decrypt
# decrypt data (default)

delete-key
# remove key from public keyring,

edit-sig
# edit a key signature. Currently you have only the option to delete
# some signatures.

encrypt
# (Can be combined with a "sign")
# encrypt data

export <names>
# Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and
# those registered via option "keyring"), or if at least one name is
# given, those of the givename. The new keyring is written to stdout
# or to the file given with option "output"

fingerprint
# show the fingerprints,

gen-key
# generate a new key pair, this is an interactive command.

gen-prime
# Generate a prime.
# With one argument:  take it as the bitsize and make a simple prime of
#		      this size
# With two arguments: Generate a prime, usable for DL algorithms.
# With three arguments: same as above, but a third argument indicates
#			that a generator should also be calculated.

list-packets
# List only the sequence of packets"},


print-mds
# print all message digests of all give filenames

sign
# (Can be combined with a "encrypt")
# make a signature

sign-key
# make a signature on a key in the keyring
# Argument is the userid of the key to sign.
# This looks for the key, displays the key and checks all
# existing signatures of this key. If the key is not yet signed
# by the default user (or the users given with "-l"), the programm
# displays the information of the key again, together with
# it's fingerprint and asked wehter it should be signed. This question
# is repeated for all users specified with "-l".  The key is then signed
# and the keyring which contains the key is updated.

store
# simply packs the input data into a rfc1991 packet format

symmetric
# encrypt the input only with the symmetric (conventional) cipher.
# This asks for a passphrase.


test
# Used for testing some parts of the program

#----------------------------------------------
#------  Options without a long form ----------
#----------------------------------------------

-k
# List keyrings.
# Without arguments, all default public keyrings are listed
# With one argument, this keyring is listed.
#
# -kv	 is the same as -k
# -kvv	 list the signatures with every key
# -kvvv  additional checks all signatures
# -kvc	 list fingerprints
# -kvvc  list fingerprints and signatures
# Note that this is a kludge, to emulate the strange pgp syntax;
# combining it with other options may give other outputs.



-z n
# Set compress level to n.
# n = 0 disables compresson. Default compress level depends on
# the local zlib (6).


#-----------------------------------------------
#------------------- Options -------------------
#-----------------------------------------------


armor
# create ascii armored output


batch
# batch mode: never ask

cache-all
# hold everything in memory


check-key
# check signatures on a key in the keyring

debug  value|hexvalue
#  set debugging flags,

debug-all
# enable full debugging


detach-sign
# make a detached signature,

dry-run
# don't make any changes


keyring  filename
# add this filename to the list of keyrings.
# If the filename begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced
# by the HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it
# is assumed to be in "~/.g10"

local-user user-string
#  use this user-string to sign or decrypt

no
# assume no on most questions

no-armor
# Assume the input data is not in ascii armored format.

no-default-keyring
# Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings

no-greeting
# suppress the initial copyright etc. messages but do not enter batch mode.

no-verbose
# set verbose level to 0

options filename
#  Ignored in option files.

output filename
# use filename for output

passphrase-fd n
# Read the passphrase from file with the descriptor n.	If you use
# 0 for n, the passphrase will be read from stdin.  This can only be used
# if only one passphrase is supplied.


remote-user
# use this user-id for encryption"

secret-keyring filename
# add filename to the list of secret keyrings
# see "keyring" for further informations

status-fd n
# Write status informations to this file descriptor. If this option
# is not used, no status information is writte.  This option is for the
# sake of a calling programm (e.g. a MUA) to ease up parsing of output
# and providing a defined set of status messages.
# FIXME: use a format ala "100 Blabla"?

verbose
# Give more informations suring processing. If used 2 times, the input data
# is listed in detail.

yes
# assume yes on most questions
