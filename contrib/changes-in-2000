New features since 1.0.0
------------------------

    * The default symmetric cipher algorithm is now AES (aka
      Rijndael).  OpenPGP uses preferences to figure out the algorithm
      to use, so this is only used if the recipient knows how to
      handles AES.

    * RSA keys can now be used (either old PGP 2 or new OpenPGP ones).
      RSA key generation is not yet available.

    * Unattended key generation.

    * Faster and more robust random number generator under W32.

    * Encryption is now much faster: About 2 times for 1k bit keys
      and 8 times for 4k keys.

    * New encryption keys are generated in a way which allows a much
      faster decryption.

    * GnuPG knows what the primary user ID is.

    * Large File Support (LFS) is working.

    * Ability to run gpg as a full controlled inferior process to speed up
      mass verification of signatures.  

    * Rewritten key selection code so that GnuPG can better cope with
      multiple subkeys, expiration dates and so on.  The drawback is that it
      is slower.

    * New utility gpgv which is a stripped down version of gpg to
      be used to verify signatures against a list of trusted keys.

    * New command --export-secret-subkeys which outputs the
      the _primary_ key with it's secret parts deleted.  This is
      useful for automated decryption/signature creation as it
      allows to keep the real secret primary key offline and
      thereby protecting the key certificates and allowing to
      create revocations for the subkeys.  See the FAQ for a
      procedure to install such secret keys.

    * New options --show-session-key and --override-session-key
      to help the British folks to somewhat minimize the danger
      of this Orwellian RIP bill.

    * New option --no-auto-key-retrieve to disable retrieving of a
      missing public key from a keyserver, even when a keyserver has
      been configured.  Useful for dial-up connections.

    * HTTP proxy support for keyservers.

    * Keyserver support is how also available for W32 platforms (MS
      Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT, ME).

    * Experimental gpg-agent support to get the passphrase from a
      daemon which can pop up a query window.  


rfc2440bis support (PGP 6.5.8 does also handle them)
-------------------

    * MDC enhanced encryption is now used with the AES and Twofish
      algorithms to detect manipulated messages. 

    * The user is now asked for the reason of a revocation.


Translations:
------------

    * Enhanced UTF-8 support

    * New translations: Danish, Estonian, Indonesian, Portuguese and
      Turkish.

Serious bug fixes:
------------------

    * Fixed a serious bug which could lead to false signature
      verification results when more than one signature is fed to gpg.
      This is the primary reason for releasing this version.

    * Protection against the recent Klima/Rosa attck on secret key
      rings.

    * Corrected hash calculation for input data larger than 512M - it
      was just wrong, so you might notice bad signature in some very
      big files.  It may be wise to keep an old copy of GnuPG around.

    * Secret keys are no longer imported unless you use the new option
      --allow-secret-key-import.

PGP quirks
----------

    * Can handle (but not display) PGP's photo IDs. 

    * Better default values to increase compatibilty with PGP.

    * Many other small enhancements to support the not fully-OpenPGP
      compliant PGP versions.

Manual
------

    * The manual called GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH) is a separate
      package and available preformatted in English, German, Italian,
      Russian and Spanish at http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html.

      on available from CVS]
