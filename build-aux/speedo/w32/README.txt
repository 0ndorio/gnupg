1. Important Notes
==================

See https://gnupg.org for latest news.  HowTo documents and manuals
can be found there but some have also been installed on your machine.

Developing GnuPG and keeping it in a healthy state is a full time job
for at least two experienced developers.  We currently do not have the
financial resources to even fully pay one person.  To change that
please consider to donate at https://gnupg.org/donate/ .


2. Record of Changes
====================

This is a list of changes to the GnuPG core for this and the previous

available under different license conditions.  Most of these packages
