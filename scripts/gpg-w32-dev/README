These makefiles are used to build a simple development package of
GnuPG related libraries for Windoze.  The ZIP archive includes only
the binaries, import libraries and header files.  On a file server you
should keep the original source tarballs close to the archive file and
explain where to find the sources.  GNU make is required.
