Hi!

Please find attached the latest version of the PO file for your GnuPG
translation ($file).  I would appreciate if you can fix any remaining
fuzzy or untranslated entries so that we are able to prepare a fine
and fully translated 1.2.2 release ASAP.  If you need access to the
code please get the latest release candidate at
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.2.2rc2.tar.gz

IMHO it is important to have a basic understanding of GnuPG's
functionality to do a correct translation.  A false translation might
need to security problems.  This is the reason why I prefer to contact
you directly and not to work only with the TP Robot.

Output of msgfmt is:
$(msgfmt --check --statistics $file 2>&1 | head)

If you are not able to continue the translation work, I suggest to
pass this message on to another translator and drop me a short note.

Thanks,

  Werner
